# Day-Scheduler
#Description
  This is a daily planner app optimized to help the user plan their day in a more organized fashion. To use this app the user will see if the current timeblock is in the present, past or future. The time blocks are color coded to indicate the current state of time grey color being past, red color being present, green color being future. The user can click on the colored section for each time block and type in a planned even for that time then click the blue save button to the right of the time block. Even when the page is reloaded the saved event will still be present so the user can close and open the application when needed.
